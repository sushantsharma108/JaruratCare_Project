Hi All,

This is a completely ReactJS based Counter app which is I have built as a project given to me by Jarurat Care Foundation.

I have used the Vite Bundler with Tailwind CSS to make this project. And I also used the GSAP Animation Library to add some animations in the application.

This application features a counter which increases as the user adds a number 1 to the current value and there's a progress bar which also increases starting from the center and it repeats the sam process when user decreases the number or subtracts the value 1 from the current value. 

This application is publicly available and anybody can use this code and also add other features in the app.

If you want to use this project then follow the steps:

1. Install the NodeJS âœ…
2. npm create vite@latest my-project    ----This will install the Vite Bundler using Tailwind CSS Website.âœ…
3. npm install -D tailwindcss postcss autoprefixer âœ…
   npx tailwindcss init -p
   These commands will install and initialize the Tailwind CSS in your project.
4. Setup the Tailwind CSS config file. âœ…
5. Run the command ---- npm run dev âœ…
6. Enjoy ðŸ˜Š
